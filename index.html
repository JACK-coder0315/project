    <h1>Project 2: Persuasive or Misleading Visualizations?</h1>

    <h2>Claim A: NYPD’s Accountability System Fails — Most Complaints Are Dismissed</h2>
    <img src="propose.png" alt="Chart A - Bar Plot">
    <p class="caption">Chart A: Over 70% of NYPD complaints were not substantiated, suggesting systemic failure in police accountability.</p>
    <p>
        This visualization supports the claim that the NYPD’s internal complaint handling system is ineffective. By using a red bar to emphasize the number of unsubstantiated complaints (23,749), it guides the viewer’s emotional reaction toward concern. The straightforward bar chart makes the imbalance visually stark and easily interpretable.
    </p>

    <h2>Claim B: Some NYPD Precincts Show High Substantiation Rates</h2>
    <img src="oppose.png" alt="Chart B - Precinct Map">
    <p class="caption">Chart B: In some NYPD precincts, more than 70–80% of complaints are substantiated, suggesting localized accountability.</p>
    <p>
        This visualization argues against the claim by highlighting that not all complaints are dismissed. In several precincts, the substantiation rate exceeds 70%, suggesting that in some areas, accountability mechanisms are working. The green color palette reinforces this positive narrative.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        While both visualizations are based on the same dataset, the design choices — color, aggregation, and framing — guide viewer perception. Chart A aggregates all complaints to emphasize overall failure, while Chart B disaggregates by location to show potential progress. Together, they demonstrate that data visualization is not purely objective: it carries rhetorical power depending on how the story is framed. For ethical visualization, transparency in intent, labeling, and context is key.
